# Windows11Patcher (WIP)
This tool aims to make the Windows 11 experience more bearable, by patching parts that are annoying to use, like the new context menu, or you might not like but can’t change that easily.

## Features

- [x] Adding/Removing context menu patch
  - Get back the old context menu by default

## How to use

Download the latest .exe file from the [release page](https://github.com/basicx-StrgV/Windows11Patcher/releases) and run it.  
The tool will then go through every possible patch and ask you if you want to apply it.  
If a patch is already applied it will ask you if you want to remove the patch.  

Restart your system after applying or removing patches.
